      "**Phase Likelihood Scoring:**\n",
      "- Score each **individual phase** from 0 to 1 (likelihood it has formed under the synthesis conditions).\n",
      "- Penalize polymorphs that are not stable at the synthesis temperature (e.g., low-T polymorphs at high T), but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n",
      "- If a polymorph is less stable but still possible due to mechanisms such as kinetic trapping or low synthesis duration, assign reduced likelihood (e.g., 0.5).\n",
      "- If a phase is a known precursor or may remain unreacted, assign moderate likelihood (e.g., 0.4–0.6). If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7–0.8).\n",
      "- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0–0.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**\n",
      "- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.\n",
      "- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.\n",
      "- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.\n",
      "- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.\n",
      "- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation. Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood — especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n",
      "- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods – Critical Rule:**\n",
      "- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label.\n",
      "- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n",
      "- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n",
      "- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Completeness Check – Requirement:**\n",
      "- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n",
      "- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n",
      "- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation Requirements:**\n",
      "- For **each phase**, provide:\n",
      "    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.\n",
      "    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it’s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n",
      "    - **Ground-state**\n",
      "    - **Metastable**\n",
      "    - **Kinetically trapped**\n",
      "    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n",
      "    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible. For example, provide rationales for whether a particular oxidation state in the product might form given starting precursors and reaction conditions. Consider whether anion groups such as carbonates are likely to decompose or be retained.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Stability Reminder (important):**\n",
      "- Do NOT allow the same interpretation to vary significantly in likelihood across runs.\n",
      "- Use deterministic logic, synthesis rules, and known reaction windows to ground your scoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, remember that these phase interpretations are from x-ray diffraction measurements and therefore correspond to solid-phase crystalline materials. Glassy materials or gas phase species will not be included in the interpretation.\n",
