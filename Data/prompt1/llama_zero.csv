TRI_30 I_1,0.1,0.1,0.0,"Target: CaV2O3<br>Precursors:CaCO3,V2O3,<br>Furnace:BF<br>Temperature:700.0 C<br>Dwell Duration:8.0","CaV2O6 (space group 12, weight fraction 100%)","The interpretation suggests a phase that is not chemically plausible given the target composition and synthesis conditions. The composition balance score is perfect, but the phase itself is unlikely to form.","The interpretation does not match the target composition and has incorrect oxidation states, making it highly implausible."
TRI_30 I_3,0.1,0.1,0.0,"Target: CaV2O3<br>Precursors:CaCO3,V2O3,<br>Furnace:BF<br>Temperature:700.0 C<br>Dwell Duration:8.0","VO2 (space group 12, weight fraction 100%)","The interpretation suggests a single phase that is not expected to form under the given conditions. The composition balance is poor, and the phase is unlikely.","The interpretation is based on an implausible phase with an unrecognized structure, making it highly unlikely."
TRI_30 I_4,0.1,0.1,0.0,"Target: CaV2O3<br>Precursors:CaCO3,V2O3,<br>Furnace:BF<br>Temperature:700.0 C<br>Dwell Duration:8.0","VO2 (space group 58, weight fraction 100%)","The interpretation suggests a single phase that is not expected to form under the given conditions. The composition balance is poor, and the phase is unlikely.","The interpretation is based on an implausible phase with an unrecognized structure, making it highly unlikely."
TRI_112 I_10,0.1,0.1,0.0,"Target: NaVO2<br>Precursors:Na2CO3,V2O3,<br>Furnace:TF-Ar + H2<br>Temperature:600.0 C<br>Dwell Duration:12.0","C (space group 13, weight fraction 100%)","This interpretation includes an implausible phase like carbon, which significantly reduces its credibility. The composition balance is poor.",This interpretation does not match the target composition at all.
