If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7\u20130.8).\n- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0\u20130.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.\n\n**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**\n- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.\n- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.\n- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.\n- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.\n- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation. Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood \u2014 especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n\n**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods \u2013 Critical Rule:**\n- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label.\n- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n\n**Completeness Check \u2013 Requirement:**\n- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n\n**Explanation Requirements:**\n- For **each phase**, provide:\n    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.\n    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it\u2019s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible. For example, provide rationales for whether a particular oxidation state in the product might form given starting precursors and reaction conditions. Consider whether anion groups such as carbonates are likely to decompose or be retained.\n\n\n**Stability Reminder (important):**\n- Do NOT allow the same interpretation to vary significantly in likelihood across runs.\n- Use deterministic logic, synthesis rules, and known reaction windows to ground your scoring.\n\nFinally, remember that these phase interpretations are from x-ray diffraction measurements and therefore correspond to solid-phase crystalline materials. Glassy materials or gas phase species will not be included in the interpretation.\n\n\n**Do not** confuse gas-phase species (e.g., CO, O\u2082) with solid phases \u2014 disqualify them appropriately.\nFormat your response as a dictionary where each interpretation key maps to a nested dictionary with:\n- \"Likelihoods\": {{phase: value}}\n- \"Explanations\": {{phase: explanation}}\n- \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": float\n- \"Interpretation_Explanation\": str\n\nThe following examples are provided for demonstration purposes:\n\n- Example 1:\nSolid state synthesis: gram-quantity precursors are mixed and heated in a furnace.\nTarget: ZrTiO4  \nPrecursors: ZrO2, TiO2  \nTemperature: 1273.15 K (1000\u00b0C)  \nDwell Duration: 4.0 hours  \nFurnace: Box furnace with ambient air\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: ZrTiO4 (space group 18, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 5.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2), TiO2 (space group 141, weight fraction 6.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2), Al2TiO5 (space group 63, weight fraction 9.00%, fractional_composition = {'Al': 0.25, 'Ti': 0.125, 'O': 0.625}, approximately equal to Al2TiO5)\n- I_2: ZrTiO4 (space group 60, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 20.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2)\n- I_3: ZrTi2O6 (space group 14, weight fraction 85.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1111, 'Ti': 0.2222, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTi2O6), TiO2 (space group 136, weight fraction 15.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.940\n- I_2: 0.900\n- I_3: 0.783\n\n\nExpected likelihoods and explanations:\n{\n\"I_1\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": 0.4,\n    \"ZrO2 (space group 14)\": 0.85,\n    \"TiO2 (space group 141)\": 0.2,\n    \"Al2TiO5 (space group 63)\": 0.6\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": \"Space group 18 (P2\u2081) is not the correct structure for ZrTiO\u2084 under high-temperature solid-state synthesis.

For each interpretation, determine the likelihood that the listed solid phases have formed under the given synthesis conditions.\nTake into account:\n- Whether the oxidation state is thermodynamically plausible (based on precursors, temperature, and synthesis atmosphere).\n- Whether the specific polymorph (space group) is known to be stable at the synthesis temperature and pressure. If multiple polymorphs exist for the same composition, prefer the polymorph known to be stable under the synthesis conditions.\n- Whether the overall elemental composition of the phases, weighted by their fractions, matches the expected target composition. Interpretations with large elemental imbalances (e.g., excess or missing cations) should be penalized. Use the provided composition balance score as an indicator of this match.\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: Ga2O3 (space group 12, weight fraction 100.0%, fractional_composition = {'Ga': 0.4, 'O': 0.6}, approximately equal to Ga2O3)\n- I_2: Ga33O50 (space group 12, weight fraction 100.0%, fractional_composition = {'Ga': 0.3976, 'O': 0.6024}, approximately equal to Ga2O3)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.375\n- I_2: 0.375\n\nInstructions:\n\n**Phase Likelihood Scoring:**\n- Score each **individual phase** from 0 to 1 (likelihood it has formed under the synthesis conditions).\n- Penalize polymorphs that are not stable at the synthesis temperature (e.g., low-T polymorphs at high T), but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- If a polymorph is less stable but still possible due to mechanisms such as kinetic trapping or low synthesis duration, assign reduced likelihood (e.g., 0.5).\n- If a phase is a known precursor or may remain unreacted, assign moderate likelihood (e.g., 0.4\u20130.6). If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7\u20130.8).\n- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0\u20130.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.\n\n**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**\n- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.\n- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.\n- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.\n- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.\n- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation. Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood \u2014 especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n\n**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods \u2013 Critical Rule:**\n- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label.\n- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n\n**Completeness Check \u2013 Requirement:**\n- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n\n**Explanation Requirements:**\n- For **each phase**, provide:\n    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.\n    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it\u2019s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible. For example, provide rationales for whether a particular oxidation state in the product might form given starting precursors and reaction conditions. Consider whether anion groups such as carbonates are likely to decompose or be retained.\n\n\n**Stability Reminder (important):**\n- Do NOT allow the same interpretation to vary significantly in likelihood across runs.\n- Use deterministic logic, synthesis rules, and known reaction windows to ground your scoring.\n\nFinally, remember that these phase interpretations are from x-ray diffraction measurements and therefore correspond to solid-phase crystalline materials. Glassy materials or gas phase species will not be included in the interpretation.\n\n\n**Do not** confuse gas-phase species (e.g., CO, O\u2082) with solid phases \u2014 disqualify them appropriately.\nFormat your response as a dictionary where each interpretation key maps to a nested dictionary with:\n- \"Likelihoods\": {{phase: value}}\n- \"Explanations\": {{phase: explanation}}\n- \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": float\n- \"Interpretation_Explanation\": str\n\nThe following examples are provided for demonstration purposes:\n\n- Example 1:\nSolid state synthesis: gram-quantity precursors are mixed and heated in a furnace.\nTarget: ZrTiO4  \nPrecursors: ZrO2, TiO2  \nTemperature: 1273.15 K (1000\u00b0C)  \nDwell Duration: 4.0 hours  \nFurnace: Box furnace with ambient air\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: ZrTiO4 (space group 18, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 5.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2), TiO2 (space group 141, weight fraction 6.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2), Al2TiO5 (space group 63, weight fraction 9.00%, fractional_composition = {'Al': 0.25, 'Ti': 0.125, 'O': 0.625}, approximately equal to Al2TiO5)\n- I_2: ZrTiO4 (space group 60, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 20.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2)\n- I_3: ZrTi2O6 (space group 14, weight fraction 85.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1111, 'Ti': 0.2222, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTi2O6), TiO2 (space group 136, weight fraction 15.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.940\n- I_2: 0.900\n- I_3: 0.783\n\n\nExpected likelihoods and explanations:\n{\n\"I_1\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": 0.4,\n    \"ZrO2 (space group 14)\": 0.85,\n    \"TiO2 (space group 141)\": 0.2,\n    \"Al2TiO5 (space group 63)\": 0.6\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": \"Space group 18 (P2\u2081) is not the correct structure for ZrTiO\u2084 under high-temperature solid-state synthesis.

Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood \u2014 especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n\n**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods \u2013 Critical Rule:**\n- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label.\n- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n\n**Completeness Check \u2013 Requirement:**\n- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n\n**Explanation Requirements:**\n- For **each phase**, provide:\n    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.\n    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it\u2019s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible. For example, provide rationales for whether a particular oxidation state in the product might form given starting precursors and reaction conditions. Consider whether anion groups such as carbonates are likely to decompose or be retained.\n\n\n**Stability Reminder (important):**\n- Do NOT allow the same interpretation to vary significantly in likelihood across runs.\n- Use deterministic logic, synthesis rules, and known reaction windows to ground your scoring.\n\nFinally, remember that these phase interpretations are from x-ray diffraction measurements and therefore correspond to solid-phase crystalline materials. Glassy materials or gas phase species will not be included in the interpretation.\n\n\n**Do not** confuse gas-phase species (e.g., CO, O\u2082) with solid phases \u2014 disqualify them appropriately.\nFormat your response as a dictionary where each interpretation key maps to a nested dictionary with:\n- \"Likelihoods\": {{phase: value}}\n- \"Explanations\": {{phase: explanation}}\n- \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": float\n- \"Interpretation_Explanation\": str\n\nThe following examples are provided for demonstration purposes:\n\n- Example 1:\nSolid state synthesis: gram-quantity precursors are mixed and heated in a furnace.\nTarget: ZrTiO4  \nPrecursors: ZrO2, TiO2  \nTemperature: 1273.15 K (1000\u00b0C)  \nDwell Duration: 4.0 hours  \nFurnace: Box furnace with ambient air\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: ZrTiO4 (space group 18, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 5.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2), TiO2 (space group 141, weight fraction 6.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2), Al2TiO5 (space group 63, weight fraction 9.00%, fractional_composition = {'Al': 0.25, 'Ti': 0.125, 'O': 0.625}, approximately equal to Al2TiO5)\n- I_2: ZrTiO4 (space group 60, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 20.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2)\n- I_3: ZrTi2O6 (space group 14, weight fraction 85.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1111, 'Ti': 0.2222, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTi2O6), TiO2 (space group 136, weight fraction 15.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.940\n- I_2: 0.900\n- I_3: 0.783\n\n\nExpected likelihoods and explanations:\n{\n\"I_1\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": 0.4,\n    \"ZrO2 (space group 14)\": 0.85,\n    \"TiO2 (space group 141)\": 0.2,\n    \"Al2TiO5 (space group 63)\": 0.6\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": \"Space group 18 (P2\u2081) is not the correct structure for ZrTiO\u2084 under high-temperature solid-state synthesis.

For each interpretation, determine the likelihood that the listed solid phases have formed under the given synthesis conditions.\nTake into account:\n- Whether the oxidation state is thermodynamically plausible (based on precursors, temperature, and synthesis atmosphere).\n- Whether the specific polymorph (space group) is known to be stable at the synthesis temperature and pressure. If multiple polymorphs exist for the same composition, prefer the polymorph known to be stable under the synthesis conditions.\n- Whether the overall elemental composition of the phases, weighted by their fractions, matches the expected target composition. Interpretations with large elemental imbalances (e.g., excess or missing cations) should be penalized. Use the provided composition balance score as an indicator of this match.\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: K10V21O57 (space group 100, weight fraction 63.68%, fractional_composition = {'K': 0.1136, 'V': 0.2386, 'O': 0.6477}, approximately equal to K3V7O19), KV3O8 (space group 11, weight fraction 36.32%, fractional_composition = {'K': 0.0833, 'V': 0.25, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to KV3O8)\n- I_2: K10V21O57 (space group 100, weight fraction 62.95%, fractional_composition = {'K': 0.1136, 'V': 0.2386, 'O': 0.6477}, approximately equal to K3V7O19), V2O5 (space group 11, weight fraction 19.2%, fractional_composition = {'V': 0.2857, 'O': 0.7143}, approximately equal to V2O5), KV3O8 (space group 11, weight fraction 17.85%, fractional_composition = {'K': 0.0833, 'V': 0.25, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to KV3O8)\n- I_3: KV3O8 (space group 11, weight fraction 100.0%, fractional_composition = {'K': 0.0833, 'V': 0.25, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to KV3O8)\n- I_4: K2V3O8 (space group 100, weight fraction 100.0%, fractional_composition = {'K': 0.1538, 'V': 0.2308, 'O': 0.6154}, approximately equal to K2V3O8)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.96\n- I_2: 0.938\n- I_3: 0.938\n- I_4: 0.99\n\nInstructions:\n\n**Phase Likelihood Scoring:**\n- Score each **individual phase** from 0 to 1 (likelihood it has formed under the synthesis conditions).\n- Penalize polymorphs that are not stable at the synthesis temperature (e.g., low-T polymorphs at high T), but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- If a polymorph is less stable but still possible due to mechanisms such as kinetic trapping or low synthesis duration, assign reduced likelihood (e.g., 0.5).\n- If a phase is a known precursor or may remain unreacted, assign moderate likelihood (e.g., 0.4\u20130.6). If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7\u20130.8).\n- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0\u20130.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.\n\n**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**\n- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.\n- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.\n- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.\n- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.\n- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation. Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood \u2014 especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n\n**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods \u2013 Critical Rule:**\n- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label.\n- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n\n**Completeness Check \u2013 Requirement:**\n- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n\n**Explanation Requirements:**\n- For **each phase**, provide:\n    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.\n    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it\u2019s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible. For example, provide rationales for whether a particular oxidation state in the product might form given starting precursors and reaction conditions. Consider whether anion groups such as carbonates are likely to decompose or be retained.\n\n\n**Stability Reminder (important):**\n- Do NOT allow the same interpretation to vary significantly in likelihood across runs.\n- Use deterministic logic, synthesis rules, and known reaction windows to ground your scoring.\n\nFinally, remember that these phase interpretations are from x-ray diffraction measurements and therefore correspond to solid-phase crystalline materials. Glassy materials or gas phase species will not be included in the interpretation.\n\n\n**Do not** confuse gas-phase species (e.g., CO, O\u2082) with solid phases \u2014 disqualify them appropriately.\nFormat your response as a dictionary where each interpretation key maps to a nested dictionary with:\n- \"Likelihoods\": {{phase: value}}\n- \"Explanations\": {{phase: explanation}}\n- \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": float\n- \"Interpretation_Explanation\": str\n\nThe following examples are provided for demonstration purposes:\n\n- Example 1:\nSolid state synthesis: gram-quantity precursors are mixed and heated in a furnace.\nTarget: ZrTiO4  \nPrecursors: ZrO2, TiO2  \nTemperature: 1273.15 K (1000\u00b0C)  \nDwell Duration: 4.0 hours  \nFurnace: Box furnace with ambient air\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: ZrTiO4 (space group 18, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 5.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2), TiO2 (space group 141, weight fraction 6.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2), Al2TiO5 (space group 63, weight fraction 9.00%, fractional_composition = {'Al': 0.25, 'Ti': 0.125, 'O': 0.625}, approximately equal to Al2TiO5)\n- I_2: ZrTiO4 (space group 60, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 20.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2)\n- I_3: ZrTi2O6 (space group 14, weight fraction 85.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1111, 'Ti': 0.2222, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTi2O6), TiO2 (space group 136, weight fraction 15.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.940\n- I_2: 0.900\n- I_3: 0.783\n\n\nExpected likelihoods and explanations:\n{\n\"I_1\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": 0.4,\n    \"ZrO2 (space group 14)\": 0.85,\n    \"TiO2 (space group 141)\": 0.2,\n    \"Al2TiO5 (space group 63)\": 0.6\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": \"Space group 18 (P2\u2081) is not the correct structure for ZrTiO\u2084 under high-temperature solid-state synthesis.

Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood \u2014 especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n\n**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods \u2013 Critical Rule:**\n- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label.\n- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n\n**Completeness Check \u2013 Requirement:**\n- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n\n**Explanation Requirements:**\n- For **each phase**, provide:\n    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.\n    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it\u2019s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible. For example, provide rationales for whether a particular oxidation state in the product might form given starting precursors and reaction conditions. Consider whether anion groups such as carbonates are likely to decompose or be retained.\n\n\n**Stability Reminder (important):**\n- Do NOT allow the same interpretation to vary significantly in likelihood across runs.\n- Use deterministic logic, synthesis rules, and known reaction windows to ground your scoring.\n\nFinally, remember that these phase interpretations are from x-ray diffraction measurements and therefore correspond to solid-phase crystalline materials. Glassy materials or gas phase species will not be included in the interpretation.\n\n\n**Do not** confuse gas-phase species (e.g., CO, O\u2082) with solid phases \u2014 disqualify them appropriately.\nFormat your response as a dictionary where each interpretation key maps to a nested dictionary with:\n- \"Likelihoods\": {{phase: value}}\n- \"Explanations\": {{phase: explanation}}\n- \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": float\n- \"Interpretation_Explanation\": str\n\nThe following examples are provided for demonstration purposes:\n\n- Example 1:\nSolid state synthesis: gram-quantity precursors are mixed and heated in a furnace.\nTarget: ZrTiO4  \nPrecursors: ZrO2, TiO2  \nTemperature: 1273.15 K (1000\u00b0C)  \nDwell Duration: 4.0 hours  \nFurnace: Box furnace with ambient air\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: ZrTiO4 (space group 18, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 5.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2), TiO2 (space group 141, weight fraction 6.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2), Al2TiO5 (space group 63, weight fraction 9.00%, fractional_composition = {'Al': 0.25, 'Ti': 0.125, 'O': 0.625}, approximately equal to Al2TiO5)\n- I_2: ZrTiO4 (space group 60, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 20.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2)\n- I_3: ZrTi2O6 (space group 14, weight fraction 85.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1111, 'Ti': 0.2222, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTi2O6), TiO2 (space group 136, weight fraction 15.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.940\n- I_2: 0.900\n- I_3: 0.783\n\n\nExpected likelihoods and explanations:\n{\n\"I_1\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": 0.4,\n    \"ZrO2 (space group 14)\": 0.85,\n    \"TiO2 (space group 141)\": 0.2,\n    \"Al2TiO5 (space group 63)\": 0.6\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": \"Space group 18 (P2\u2081) is not the correct structure for ZrTiO\u2084 under high-temperature solid-state synthesis.

For each interpretation, determine the likelihood that the listed solid phases have formed under the given synthesis conditions.\nTake into account:\n- Whether the oxidation state is thermodynamically plausible (based on precursors, temperature, and synthesis atmosphere).\n- Whether the specific polymorph (space group) is known to be stable at the synthesis temperature and pressure. If multiple polymorphs exist for the same composition, prefer the polymorph known to be stable under the synthesis conditions.\n- Whether the overall elemental composition of the phases, weighted by their fractions, matches the expected target composition.

If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7\u20130.8).\n- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0\u20130.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.\n\n**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**\n- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.\n- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.\n- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.\n- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.\n- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation. Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood \u2014 especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n\n**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods \u2013 Critical Rule:**\n- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label.\n- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n\n**Completeness Check \u2013 Requirement:**\n- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n\n**Explanation Requirements:**\n- For **each phase**, provide:\n    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.\n    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it\u2019s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible.

For each interpretation, determine the likelihood that the listed solid phases have formed under the given synthesis conditions.\nTake into account:\n- Whether the oxidation state is thermodynamically plausible (based on precursors, temperature, and synthesis atmosphere).\n- Whether the specific polymorph (space group) is known to be stable at the synthesis temperature and pressure. If multiple polymorphs exist for the same composition, prefer the polymorph known to be stable under the synthesis conditions.\n- Whether the overall elemental composition of the phases, weighted by their fractions, matches the expected target composition. Interpretations with large elemental imbalances (e.g., excess or missing cations) should be penalized. Use the provided composition balance score as an indicator of this match.\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: LiV3O8 (space group 11, weight fraction 100.0%, fractional_composition = {'Li': 0.0833, 'V': 0.25, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to LiV3O8)\n- I_2: Li14V43O114 (space group 11, weight fraction 85.12%, fractional_composition = {'Li': 0.0819, 'V': 0.2515, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to LiV3O8), Li4CO5 (space group 15, weight fraction 14.88%, fractional_composition = {'Li': 0.4, 'C': 0.1, 'O': 0.5}, approximately equal to Li4CO5)\n- I_3: LiV3O8 (space group 11, weight fraction 85.86%, fractional_composition = {'Li': 0.0833, 'V': 0.25, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to LiV3O8), Li4CO5 (space group 15, weight fraction 14.14%, fractional_composition = {'Li': 0.4, 'C': 0.1, 'O': 0.5}, approximately equal to Li4CO5)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.938\n- I_2: 0.98\n- I_3: 0.98\n\nInstructions:\n\n**Phase Likelihood Scoring:**\n- Score each **individual phase** from 0 to 1 (likelihood it has formed under the synthesis conditions).\n- Penalize polymorphs that are not stable at the synthesis temperature (e.g., low-T polymorphs at high T), but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- If a polymorph is less stable but still possible due to mechanisms such as kinetic trapping or low synthesis duration, assign reduced likelihood (e.g., 0.5).\n- If a phase is a known precursor or may remain unreacted, assign moderate likelihood (e.g., 0.4\u20130.6). If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7\u20130.8).\n- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0\u20130.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.\n\n**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**\n- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.\n- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.\n- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.\n- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.\n- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation. Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood \u2014 especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n\n**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods \u2013 Critical Rule:**\n- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label.\n- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n\n**Completeness Check \u2013 Requirement:**\n- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n\n**Explanation Requirements:**\n- For **each phase**, provide:\n    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.\n    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it\u2019s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible. For example, provide rationales for whether a particular oxidation state in the product might form given starting precursors and reaction conditions. Consider whether anion groups such as carbonates are likely to decompose or be retained.\n\n\n**Stability Reminder (important):**\n- Do NOT allow the same interpretation to vary significantly in likelihood across runs.\n- Use deterministic logic, synthesis rules, and known reaction windows to ground your scoring.\n\nFinally, remember that these phase interpretations are from x-ray diffraction measurements and therefore correspond to solid-phase crystalline materials.

For each interpretation, determine the likelihood that the listed solid phases have formed under the given synthesis conditions.\nTake into account:\n- Whether the oxidation state is thermodynamically plausible (based on precursors, temperature, and synthesis atmosphere).\n- Whether the specific polymorph (space group) is known to be stable at the synthesis temperature and pressure. If multiple polymorphs exist for the same composition, prefer the polymorph known to be stable under the synthesis conditions.\n- Whether the overall elemental composition of the phases, weighted by their fractions, matches the expected target composition. Interpretations with large elemental imbalances (e.g., excess or missing cations) should be penalized. Use the provided composition balance score as an indicator of this match.\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: V2O3 (space group 167, weight fraction 100.0%, fractional_composition = {'V': 0.4, 'O': 0.6}, approximately equal to V2O3)\n- I_2: V2O3 (space group 167, weight fraction 81.77%, fractional_composition = {'V': 0.4, 'O': 0.6}, approximately equal to V2O3), Ca5V3O13 (space group 176, weight fraction 18.23%, fractional_composition = {'Ca': 0.2381, 'V': 0.1429, 'O': 0.619}, approximately equal to Ca5V3O13)\n- I_3: V2O3 (space group 15, weight fraction 66.51%, fractional_composition = {'V': 0.4, 'O': 0.6}, approximately equal to V2O3), Ca5V3O13 (space group 176, weight fraction 33.49%, fractional_composition = {'Ca': 0.2381, 'V': 0.1429, 'O': 0.619}, approximately equal to Ca5V3O13)\n- I_4: V2O3 (space group 15, weight fraction 100.0%, fractional_composition = {'V': 0.4, 'O': 0.6}, approximately equal to V2O3)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.593\n- I_2: 0.95\n- I_3: 0.985\n- I_4: 0.593\n\nInstructions:\n\n**Phase Likelihood Scoring:**\n- Score each **individual phase** from 0 to 1 (likelihood it has formed under the synthesis conditions).\n- Penalize polymorphs that are not stable at the synthesis temperature (e.g., low-T polymorphs at high T), but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- If a polymorph is less stable but still possible due to mechanisms such as kinetic trapping or low synthesis duration, assign reduced likelihood (e.g., 0.5).\n- If a phase is a known precursor or may remain unreacted, assign moderate likelihood (e.g., 0.4\u20130.6). If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7\u20130.8).\n- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0\u20130.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.\n\n**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**\n- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.\n- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.\n- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.\n- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.\n- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation. Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood \u2014 especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n\n**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods \u2013 Critical Rule:**\n- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label.\n- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n\n**Completeness Check \u2013 Requirement:**\n- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n\n**Explanation Requirements:**\n- For **each phase**, provide:\n    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.\n    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it\u2019s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible. For example, provide rationales for whether a particular oxidation state in the product might form given starting precursors and reaction conditions. Consider whether anion groups such as carbonates are likely to decompose or be retained.\n\n\n**Stability Reminder (important):**\n- Do NOT allow the same interpretation to vary significantly in likelihood across runs.\n- Use deterministic logic, synthesis rules, and known reaction windows to ground your scoring.\n\nFinally, remember that these phase interpretations are from x-ray diffraction measurements and therefore correspond to solid-phase crystalline materials. Glassy materials or gas phase species will not be included in the interpretation.\n\n\n**Do not** confuse gas-phase species (e.g., CO, O\u2082) with solid phases \u2014 disqualify them appropriately.\nFormat your response as a dictionary where each interpretation key maps to a nested dictionary with:\n- \"Likelihoods\": {{phase: value}}\n- \"Explanations\": {{phase: explanation}}\n- \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": float\n- \"Interpretation_Explanation\": str\n\nThe following examples are provided for demonstration purposes:\n\n- Example 1:\nSolid state synthesis: gram-quantity precursors are mixed and heated in a furnace.\nTarget: ZrTiO4  \nPrecursors: ZrO2, TiO2  \nTemperature: 1273.15 K (1000\u00b0C)  \nDwell Duration: 4.0 hours  \nFurnace: Box furnace with ambient air\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: ZrTiO4 (space group 18, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 5.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2), TiO2 (space group 141, weight fraction 6.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2), Al2TiO5 (space group 63, weight fraction 9.00%, fractional_composition = {'Al': 0.25, 'Ti': 0.125, 'O': 0.625}, approximately equal to Al2TiO5)\n- I_2: ZrTiO4 (space group 60, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 20.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2)\n- I_3: ZrTi2O6 (space group 14, weight fraction 85.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1111, 'Ti': 0.2222, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTi2O6), TiO2 (space group 136, weight fraction 15.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.940\n- I_2: 0.900\n- I_3: 0.783\n\n\nExpected likelihoods and explanations:\n{\n\"I_1\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": 0.4,\n    \"ZrO2 (space group 14)\": 0.85,\n    \"TiO2 (space group 141)\": 0.2,\n    \"Al2TiO5 (space group 63)\": 0.6\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": \"Space group 18 (P2\u2081) is not the correct structure for ZrTiO\u2084 under high-temperature solid-state synthesis.

For each interpretation, determine the likelihood that the listed solid phases have formed under the given synthesis conditions.\nTake into account:\n- Whether the oxidation state is thermodynamically plausible (based on precursors, temperature, and synthesis atmosphere).\n- Whether the specific polymorph (space group) is known to be stable at the synthesis temperature and pressure. If multiple polymorphs exist for the same composition, prefer the polymorph known to be stable under the synthesis conditions.\n- Whether the overall elemental composition of the phases, weighted by their fractions, matches the expected target composition. Interpretations with large elemental imbalances (e.g., excess or missing cations) should be penalized. Use the provided composition balance score as an indicator of this match.\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: V2O3 (space group 15, weight fraction 58.67%, fractional_composition = {'V': 0.4, 'O': 0.6}, approximately equal to V2O3), CO (space group 194, weight fraction 41.33%, fractional_composition = {'C': 0.5, 'O': 0.5}, approximately equal to CO)\n- I_2: V2O3 (space group 167, weight fraction 59.18%, fractional_composition = {'V': 0.4, 'O': 0.6}, approximately equal to V2O3), CO (space group 194, weight fraction 40.82%, fractional_composition = {'C': 0.5, 'O': 0.5}, approximately equal to CO)\n- I_3: V2O3 (space group 15, weight fraction 100.0%, fractional_composition = {'V': 0.4, 'O': 0.6}, approximately equal to V2O3)\n- I_4: V2O3 (space group 167, weight fraction 100.0%, fractional_composition = {'V': 0.4, 'O': 0.6}, approximately equal to V2O3)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.375\n- I_2: 0.375\n- I_3: 0.375\n- I_4: 0.375\n\nInstructions:\n\n**Phase Likelihood Scoring:**\n- Score each **individual phase** from 0 to 1 (likelihood it has formed under the synthesis conditions).\n- Penalize polymorphs that are not stable at the synthesis temperature (e.g., low-T polymorphs at high T), but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- If a polymorph is less stable but still possible due to mechanisms such as kinetic trapping or low synthesis duration, assign reduced likelihood (e.g., 0.5).\n- If a phase is a known precursor or may remain unreacted, assign moderate likelihood (e.g., 0.4\u20130.6). If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7\u20130.8).\n- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0\u20130.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.\n\n**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**\n- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.\n- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.\n- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.\n- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.\n- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation. Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood \u2014 especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n\n**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods \u2013 Critical Rule:**\n- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label.\n- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n\n**Completeness Check \u2013 Requirement:**\n- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n\n**Explanation Requirements:**\n- For **each phase**, provide:\n    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.\n    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it\u2019s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible. For example, provide rationales for whether a particular oxidation state in the product might form given starting precursors and reaction conditions. Consider whether anion groups such as carbonates are likely to decompose or be retained.\n\n\n**Stability Reminder (important):**\n- Do NOT allow the same interpretation to vary significantly in likelihood across runs.\n- Use deterministic logic, synthesis rules, and known reaction windows to ground your scoring.\n\nFinally, remember that these phase interpretations are from x-ray diffraction measurements and therefore correspond to solid-phase crystalline materials. Glassy materials or gas phase species will not be included in the interpretation.\n\n\n**Do not** confuse gas-phase species (e.g., CO, O\u2082) with solid phases \u2014 disqualify them appropriately.\nFormat your response as a dictionary where each interpretation key maps to a nested dictionary with:\n- \"Likelihoods\": {{phase: value}}\n- \"Explanations\": {{phase: explanation}}\n- \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": float\n- \"Interpretation_Explanation\": str\n\nThe following examples are provided for demonstration purposes:\n\n- Example 1:\nSolid state synthesis: gram-quantity precursors are mixed and heated in a furnace.\nTarget: ZrTiO4  \nPrecursors: ZrO2, TiO2  \nTemperature: 1273.15 K (1000\u00b0C)  \nDwell Duration: 4.0 hours  \nFurnace: Box furnace with ambient air\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: ZrTiO4 (space group 18, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 5.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2), TiO2 (space group 141, weight fraction 6.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2), Al2TiO5 (space group 63, weight fraction 9.00%, fractional_composition = {'Al': 0.25, 'Ti': 0.125, 'O': 0.625}, approximately equal to Al2TiO5)\n- I_2: ZrTiO4 (space group 60, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 20.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2)\n- I_3: ZrTi2O6 (space group 14, weight fraction 85.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1111, 'Ti': 0.2222, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTi2O6), TiO2 (space group 136, weight fraction 15.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.940\n- I_2: 0.900\n- I_3: 0.783\n\n\nExpected likelihoods and explanations:\n{\n\"I_1\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": 0.4,\n    \"ZrO2 (space group 14)\": 0.85,\n    \"TiO2 (space group 141)\": 0.2,\n    \"Al2TiO5 (space group 63)\": 0.6\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": \"Space group 18 (P2\u2081) is not the correct structure for ZrTiO\u2084 under high-temperature solid-state synthesis.

Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible. For example, provide rationales for whether a particular oxidation state in the product might form given starting precursors and reaction conditions. Consider whether anion groups such as carbonates are likely to decompose or be retained.\n\n\n**Stability Reminder (important):**\n- Do NOT allow the same interpretation to vary significantly in likelihood across runs.\n- Use deterministic logic, synthesis rules, and known reaction windows to ground your scoring.\n\nFinally, remember that these phase interpretations are from x-ray diffraction measurements and therefore correspond to solid-phase crystalline materials. Glassy materials or gas phase species will not be included in the interpretation.\n\n\n**Do not** confuse gas-phase species (e.g., CO, O\u2082) with solid phases \u2014 disqualify them appropriately.\nFormat your response as a dictionary where each interpretation key maps to a nested dictionary with:\n- \"Likelihoods\": {{phase: value}}\n- \"Explanations\": {{phase: explanation}}\n- \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": float\n- \"Interpretation_Explanation\": str\n\nThe following examples are provided for demonstration purposes:\n\n- Example 1:\nSolid state synthesis: gram-quantity precursors are mixed and heated in a furnace.\nTarget: ZrTiO4  \nPrecursors: ZrO2, TiO2  \nTemperature: 1273.15 K (1000\u00b0C)  \nDwell Duration: 4.0 hours  \nFurnace: Box furnace with ambient air\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: ZrTiO4 (space group 18, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 5.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2), TiO2 (space group 141, weight fraction 6.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2), Al2TiO5 (space group 63, weight fraction 9.00%, fractional_composition = {'Al': 0.25, 'Ti': 0.125, 'O': 0.625}, approximately equal to Al2TiO5)\n- I_2: ZrTiO4 (space group 60, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 20.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2)\n- I_3: ZrTi2O6 (space group 14, weight fraction 85.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1111, 'Ti': 0.2222, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTi2O6), TiO2 (space group 136, weight fraction 15.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.940\n- I_2: 0.900\n- I_3: 0.783\n\n\nExpected likelihoods and explanations:\n{\n\"I_1\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": 0.4,\n    \"ZrO2 (space group 14)\": 0.85,\n    \"TiO2 (space group 141)\": 0.2,\n    \"Al2TiO5 (space group 63)\": 0.6\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": \"Space group 18 (P2\u2081) is not the correct structure for ZrTiO\u2084 under high-temperature solid-state synthesis.

If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7\u20130.8).\n- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0\u20130.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.\n\n**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**\n- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.\n- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.\n- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.\n- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.\n- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation. Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood \u2014 especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n\n**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods \u2013 Critical Rule:**\n- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label.\n- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n\n**Completeness Check \u2013 Requirement:**\n- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n\n**Explanation Requirements:**\n- For **each phase**, provide:\n    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.\n    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it\u2019s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible.

For each interpretation, determine the likelihood that the listed solid phases have formed under the given synthesis conditions.\nTake into account:\n- Whether the oxidation state is thermodynamically plausible (based on precursors, temperature, and synthesis atmosphere).\n- Whether the specific polymorph (space group) is known to be stable at the synthesis temperature and pressure. If multiple polymorphs exist for the same composition, prefer the polymorph known to be stable under the synthesis conditions.\n- Whether the overall elemental composition of the phases, weighted by their fractions, matches the expected target composition. Interpretations with large elemental imbalances (e.g., excess or missing cations) should be penalized. Use the provided composition balance score as an indicator of this match.\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: Li14V43O114 (space group 11, weight fraction 100.0%, fractional_composition = {'Li': 0.0819, 'V': 0.2515, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to LiV3O8)\n- I_2: LiV3O8 (space group 11, weight fraction 100.0%, fractional_composition = {'Li': 0.0833, 'V': 0.25, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to LiV3O8)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 1\n- I_2: 1\n\nInstructions:\n\n**Phase Likelihood Scoring:**\n- Score each **individual phase** from 0 to 1 (likelihood it has formed under the synthesis conditions).\n- Penalize polymorphs that are not stable at the synthesis temperature (e.g., low-T polymorphs at high T), but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- If a polymorph is less stable but still possible due to mechanisms such as kinetic trapping or low synthesis duration, assign reduced likelihood (e.g., 0.5).\n- If a phase is a known precursor or may remain unreacted, assign moderate likelihood (e.g., 0.4\u20130.6). If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7\u20130.8).\n- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0\u20130.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.\n\n**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**\n- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.\n- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.\n- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.\n- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.\n- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation. Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood \u2014 especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n\n**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods \u2013 Critical Rule:**\n- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label.\n- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n\n**Completeness Check \u2013 Requirement:**\n- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n\n**Explanation Requirements:**\n- For **each phase**, provide:\n    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.\n    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it\u2019s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible. For example, provide rationales for whether a particular oxidation state in the product might form given starting precursors and reaction conditions. Consider whether anion groups such as carbonates are likely to decompose or be retained.\n\n\n**Stability Reminder (important):**\n- Do NOT allow the same interpretation to vary significantly in likelihood across runs.\n- Use deterministic logic, synthesis rules, and known reaction windows to ground your scoring.\n\nFinally, remember that these phase interpretations are from x-ray diffraction measurements and therefore correspond to solid-phase crystalline materials. Glassy materials or gas phase species will not be included in the interpretation.\n\n\n**Do not** confuse gas-phase species (e.g., CO, O\u2082) with solid phases \u2014 disqualify them appropriately.\nFormat your response as a dictionary where each interpretation key maps to a nested dictionary with:\n- \"Likelihoods\": {{phase: value}}\n- \"Explanations\": {{phase: explanation}}\n- \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": float\n- \"Interpretation_Explanation\": str\n\nThe following examples are provided for demonstration purposes:\n\n- Example 1:\nSolid state synthesis: gram-quantity precursors are mixed and heated in a furnace.\nTarget: ZrTiO4  \nPrecursors: ZrO2, TiO2  \nTemperature: 1273.15 K (1000\u00b0C)  \nDwell Duration: 4.0 hours  \nFurnace: Box furnace with ambient air\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: ZrTiO4 (space group 18, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 5.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2), TiO2 (space group 141, weight fraction 6.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2), Al2TiO5 (space group 63, weight fraction 9.00%, fractional_composition = {'Al': 0.25, 'Ti': 0.125, 'O': 0.625}, approximately equal to Al2TiO5)\n- I_2: ZrTiO4 (space group 60, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 20.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2)\n- I_3: ZrTi2O6 (space group 14, weight fraction 85.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1111, 'Ti': 0.2222, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTi2O6), TiO2 (space group 136, weight fraction 15.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.940\n- I_2: 0.900\n- I_3: 0.783\n\n\nExpected likelihoods and explanations:\n{\n\"I_1\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": 0.4,\n    \"ZrO2 (space group 14)\": 0.85,\n    \"TiO2 (space group 141)\": 0.2,\n    \"Al2TiO5 (space group 63)\": 0.6\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": \"Space group 18 (P2\u2081) is not the correct structure for ZrTiO\u2084 under high-temperature solid-state synthesis.

If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7\u20130.8).\n- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0\u20130.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.\n\n**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**\n- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.\n- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.\n- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.\n- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.\n- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation. Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood \u2014 especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n\n**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods \u2013 Critical Rule:**\n- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label.\n- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n\n**Completeness Check \u2013 Requirement:**\n- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n\n**Explanation Requirements:**\n- For **each phase**, provide:\n    1.

For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it\u2019s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible.

For each interpretation, determine the likelihood that the listed solid phases have formed under the given synthesis conditions.\nTake into account:\n- Whether the oxidation state is thermodynamically plausible (based on precursors, temperature, and synthesis atmosphere).\n- Whether the specific polymorph (space group) is known to be stable at the synthesis temperature and pressure. If multiple polymorphs exist for the same composition, prefer the polymorph known to be stable under the synthesis conditions.\n- Whether the overall elemental composition of the phases, weighted by their fractions, matches the expected target composition.

If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7\u20130.8).\n- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0\u20130.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.\n\n**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**\n- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.\n- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.\n- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.\n- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.\n- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation. Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood \u2014 especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n\n**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods \u2013 Critical Rule:**\n- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label.\n- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n\n**Completeness Check \u2013 Requirement:**\n- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n\n**Explanation Requirements:**\n- For **each phase**, provide:\n    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.\n    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it\u2019s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible.

If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7\u20130.8).\n- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0\u20130.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.\n\n**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**\n- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.\n- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.\n- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.\n- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.\n- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation. Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood \u2014 especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n\n**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods \u2013 Critical Rule:**\n- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label.\n- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n\n**Completeness Check \u2013 Requirement:**\n- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n\n**Explanation Requirements:**\n- For **each phase**, provide:\n    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.\n    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it\u2019s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible. For example, provide rationales for whether a particular oxidation state in the product might form given starting precursors and reaction conditions. Consider whether anion groups such as carbonates are likely to decompose or be retained.\n\n\n**Stability Reminder (important):**\n- Do NOT allow the same interpretation to vary significantly in likelihood across runs.\n- Use deterministic logic, synthesis rules, and known reaction windows to ground your scoring.\n\nFinally, remember that these phase interpretations are from x-ray diffraction measurements and therefore correspond to solid-phase crystalline materials. Glassy materials or gas phase species will not be included in the interpretation.\n\n\n**Do not** confuse gas-phase species (e.g., CO, O\u2082) with solid phases \u2014 disqualify them appropriately.\nFormat your response as a dictionary where each interpretation key maps to a nested dictionary with:\n- \"Likelihoods\": {{phase: value}}\n- \"Explanations\": {{phase: explanation}}\n- \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": float\n- \"Interpretation_Explanation\": str\n\nThe following examples are provided for demonstration purposes:\n\n- Example 1:\nSolid state synthesis: gram-quantity precursors are mixed and heated in a furnace.\nTarget: ZrTiO4  \nPrecursors: ZrO2, TiO2  \nTemperature: 1273.15 K (1000\u00b0C)  \nDwell Duration: 4.0 hours  \nFurnace: Box furnace with ambient air\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: ZrTiO4 (space group 18, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 5.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2), TiO2 (space group 141, weight fraction 6.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2), Al2TiO5 (space group 63, weight fraction 9.00%, fractional_composition = {'Al': 0.25, 'Ti': 0.125, 'O': 0.625}, approximately equal to Al2TiO5)\n- I_2: ZrTiO4 (space group 60, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 20.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2)\n- I_3: ZrTi2O6 (space group 14, weight fraction 85.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1111, 'Ti': 0.2222, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTi2O6), TiO2 (space group 136, weight fraction 15.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.940\n- I_2: 0.900\n- I_3: 0.783\n\n\nExpected likelihoods and explanations:\n{\n\"I_1\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": 0.4,\n    \"ZrO2 (space group 14)\": 0.85,\n    \"TiO2 (space group 141)\": 0.2,\n    \"Al2TiO5 (space group 63)\": 0.6\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": \"Space group 18 (P2\u2081) is not the correct structure for ZrTiO\u2084 under high-temperature solid-state synthesis.
