        "Prompt": "Please tell me why you are mixing phases from interpretation 2 into interpretation 1 in some samples. then\nGiven the following synthesis data:\nSolid state synthesis: gram-quantity precursors are mixed and heated in a furnace.\nTarget: GaSbO4\nPrecursors: Ga2O3, Sb2O5\nTemperature: 873.15 K (600.0\u00b0C)\nDwell Duration: 4.0 hours\nFurnace: Box furnace with ambient air\n\nBelow are multiple proposed phase interpretations. For each interpretation, determine the likelihood that the listed solid phases have formed under the given synthesis conditions.\nTake into account:\n- Whether the oxidation state is thermodynamically plausible (based on precursors, temperature, and synthesis atmosphere).\n- Whether the specific polymorph (space group) is known to be stable at the synthesis temperature and pressure. If multiple polymorphs exist for the same composition, prefer the polymorph known to be stable under the synthesis conditions.\n- Whether the overall elemental composition of the phases, weighted by their fractions, matches the expected target composition. Interpretations with large elemental imbalances (e.g., excess or missing cations) should be penalized. Use the provided composition balance score as an indicator of this match.\n\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: Ga33O50 (space group 12, weight fraction 100.0%, fractional_composition = {'Ga': 0.3976, 'O': 0.6024}, approximately equal to Ga2O3)\n- I_2: Ga2O3 (space group 12, weight fraction 100.0%, fractional_composition = {'Ga': 0.4, 'O': 0.6}, approximately equal to Ga2O3)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.375\n- I_2: 0.375\n\nInstructions:\n\n**Phase Likelihood Scoring:**\n- Score each **individual phase** from 0 to 1 (likelihood it has formed under the synthesis conditions).\n- Penalize polymorphs that are not stable at the synthesis temperature (e.g., low-T polymorphs at high T), but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- If a polymorph is less stable but still possible due to mechanisms such as kinetic trapping or low synthesis duration, assign reduced likelihood (e.g., 0.5).\n- If a phase is a known precursor or may remain unreacted, assign moderate likelihood (e.g., 0.4\u20130.6). If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7\u20130.8).\n- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0\u20130.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.\n\n**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**\n- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.\n- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.\n- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.\n- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.\n- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation. Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood \u2014 especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n\n**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods \u2013 Critical Rule:**\n- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label. \n- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n- Do not copy, add, or infer phases from one interpretation into another. Each interpretation must be evaluated only using the exact list of phases it provides. Phases from other interpretations must not be introduced under any condition, even if they are plausible or similar.\n- Phases with the same formula but different space groups must be treated as separate, unique phases. Do not merge or remove them. If both appear in an interpretation, evaluate each separately. Their phase likelihoods may differ based on stability or polymorph identity.\n\n**Completeness Check \u2013 Requirement:**\n- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n\n**Explanation Requirements:**\n- For **each phase**, provide:\n    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.\n    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it\u2019s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible. For example, provide rationales for whether a particular oxidation state in the product might form given starting precursors and reaction conditions. Consider whether anion groups such as carbonates are likely to decompose or be retained.\n\n\n**Stability Reminder (important):**\n- Do NOT allow the same interpretation to vary significantly in likelihood across runs.\n- Use deterministic logic, synthesis rules, and known reaction windows to ground your scoring.\n\nFinally, remember that these phase interpretations are from x-ray diffraction measurements and therefore correspond to solid-phase crystalline materials. Glassy materials or gas phase species will not be included in the interpretation.\n\n\n**Do not** confuse gas-phase species (e.g., CO, O\u2082) with solid phases \u2014 disqualify them appropriately.\nFormat your response as a dictionary where each interpretation key maps to a nested dictionary with:\n- \"Likelihoods\": {{phase (space group #): value(float)}}\n- \"Explanations\": {{phase (space group #): explanation(str)}}\n- \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": float\n- \"Interpretation_Explanation\": str\n\nThe following examples are provided for demonstration purposes:\n\n- Example 1:\nSolid state synthesis: gram-quantity precursors are mixed and heated in a furnace.\nTarget: ZrTiO4  \nPrecursors: ZrO2, TiO2  \nTemperature: 1273.15 K (1000\u00b0C)  \nDwell Duration: 4.0 hours  \nFurnace: Box furnace with ambient air\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: ZrTiO4 (space group 18, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 5.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2), TiO2 (space group 141, weight fraction 6.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2), Al2TiO5 (space group 63, weight fraction 9.00%, fractional_composition = {'Al': 0.25, 'Ti': 0.125, 'O': 0.625}, approximately equal to Al2TiO5)\n- I_2: ZrTiO4 (space group 60, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 20.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2)\n- I_3: ZrTi2O6 (space group 14, weight fraction 85.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1111, 'Ti': 0.2222, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTi2O6), TiO2 (space group 136, weight fraction 15.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.940\n- I_2: 0.900\n- I_3: 0.783\n\n\nExpected likelihoods and explanations:\n{\n\"I_1\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": 0.4,\n    \"ZrO2 (space group 14)\": 0.85,\n    \"TiO2 (space group 141)\": 0.2,\n    \"Al2TiO5 (space group 63)\": 0.6\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": \"Space group 18 (P2\u2081) is not the correct structure for ZrTiO\u2084 under high-temperature solid-state synthesis.

        "response": "## Step 1: Understanding the Task\nThe task involves evaluating the likelihood of different phase interpretations for a given solid-state synthesis. The target composition is GaSbO4, and the precursors are Ga2O3 and Sb2O5. The synthesis conditions include a temperature of 873.15 K (600.0\u00b0C), a dwell duration of 4.0 hours, and a furnace with ambient air.\n\n## 2: Evaluating Interpretation I_1\nInterpretation I_1 consists of Ga33O50 (space group 12) with a weight fraction of 100.0%. This phase is approximately equal to Ga2O3. \n\n## 3: Likelihood and Explanation for I_1\nThe likelihood of Ga33O50 (space group 12) forming under these conditions can be assessed based on its thermodynamic plausibility and stability. Given that Ga2O3 is a stable oxide of gallium and commonly observed, phases closely related to Ga2O3 are plausible. However, the exact match to Ga33O50 needs consideration of known gallium oxide phases.\n\n## 4: Evaluating Interpretation I_2\nInterpretation I_2 consists of Ga2O3 (space group 12) with a weight fraction of 100.0%. This directly corresponds to one of the starting precursors.\n\n## 5: Likelihood and Explanation for I_2\nThe likelihood of Ga2O3 (space group 12) is high because it is one of the starting materials and a known stable phase at these conditions.\n\n## 6: Assessing Composition Balance and Plausibility\nThe composition balance score for I_1 and I_2 is 0.375, indicating some imbalance or deviation from the target composition GaSbO4. The target involves both Ga and Sb, suggesting a reaction between Ga2O3 and Sb2O5 to form GaSbO4 is expected.\n\n## 7: Considering Reaction and Possible Products\nThe reaction between Ga2O3 and Sb2O5 to form GaSbO4 is thermodynamically plausible. However, the provided interpretations do not directly include GaSbO4 or phases that would suggest its formation.\n\n## 8: Final Assessment\nGiven the information and typical phase behavior:\n- I_1 and I_2 seem to represent unreacted or partially reacted precursors rather than the target phase GaSbO4.\n- The stability and commonality of Ga2O3 make it a plausible phase.\n- The absence of Sb-containing phases or the target GaSbO4 in the interpretations suggests these may not fully capture the synthesis outcome.\n\n## 9: Calculation of Likelihoods and Explanations\nBased on the guidelines:\n- Phases like Ga2O3 are stable and expected.\n- The target phase GaSbO4 is not listed, suggesting incomplete reaction or alternative interpretations are needed.\n\nThe final answer is: \n{\n\"I_1\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n        \"Ga33O50 (space group 12)\": 0.4\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n        \"Ga33O50 (space group 12)\": \"Ga33O50 is approximately equal to Ga2O3, a stable phase.

If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7\u20130.8).\n- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0\u20130.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.\n\n**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**\n- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.\n- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.\n- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.\n- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.\n- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation. Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood \u2014 especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n\n**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods \u2013 Critical Rule:**\n- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label. \n- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n- Do not copy, add, or infer phases from one interpretation into another. Each interpretation must be evaluated only using the exact list of phases it provides. Phases from other interpretations must not be introduced under any condition, even if they are plausible or similar.\n- Phases with the same formula but different space groups must be treated as separate, unique phases. Do not merge or remove them. If both appear in an interpretation, evaluate each separately. Their phase likelihoods may differ based on stability or polymorph identity.\n\n**Completeness Check \u2013 Requirement:**\n- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n\n**Explanation Requirements:**\n- For **each phase**, provide:\n    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.\n    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it\u2019s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible. For example, provide rationales for whether a particular oxidation state in the product might form given starting precursors and reaction conditions. Consider whether anion groups such as carbonates are likely to decompose or be retained.\n\n\n**Stability Reminder (important):**\n- Do NOT allow the same interpretation to vary significantly in likelihood across runs.\n- Use deterministic logic, synthesis rules, and known reaction windows to ground your scoring.\n\nFinally, remember that these phase interpretations are from x-ray diffraction measurements and therefore correspond to solid-phase crystalline materials.

If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7\u20130.8).\n- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0\u20130.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.\n\n**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**\n- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.\n- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.\n- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.\n- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.\n- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation. Phases with higher weight fractions must contribute proportionally more to the interpretation likelihood \u2014 especially if their individual phase likelihood is low, they should heavily penalize the interpretation.\n- Take into account on how likely is an interpretation the composition balance.\n\n**Phase and Interpretation Likelihoods \u2013 Critical Rule:**\n- When scoring or evaluating phase likelihoods, judge based on the approximately equal to identity, not the formula label. \n- Phases with the same \"approximately equal to\" must be assigned the same phase likelihood, regardless of their formula or how they appear across interpretations.\n- Do not penalize complex or unusual formulas if their \"approximately equal to\" matches a known plausible phase.\n- When evaluating interpretation plausibility, consider the combined presence and total weight of all phases with the same approximately equal to identity.\n- Do not copy, add, or infer phases from one interpretation into another. Each interpretation must be evaluated only using the exact list of phases it provides. Phases from other interpretations must not be introduced under any condition, even if they are plausible or similar.\n- Phases with the same formula but different space groups must be treated as separate, unique phases. Do not merge or remove them. If both appear in an interpretation, evaluate each separately. Their phase likelihoods may differ based on stability or polymorph identity.\n\n**Completeness Check \u2013 Requirement:**\n- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.\n- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.\n- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.\n\n**Explanation Requirements:**\n- For **each phase**, provide:\n    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.\n    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it\u2019s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:\n    - **Ground-state**\n    - **Metastable**\n    - **Kinetically trapped**\n    - **Unknown/ambiguous**\n    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible. For example, provide rationales for whether a particular oxidation state in the product might form given starting precursors and reaction conditions. Consider whether anion groups such as carbonates are likely to decompose or be retained.\n\n\n**Stability Reminder (important):**\n- Do NOT allow the same interpretation to vary significantly in likelihood across runs.\n- Use deterministic logic, synthesis rules, and known reaction windows to ground your scoring.\n\nFinally, remember that these phase interpretations are from x-ray diffraction measurements and therefore correspond to solid-phase crystalline materials. Glassy materials or gas phase species will not be included in the interpretation.\n\n\n**Do not** confuse gas-phase species (e.g., CO, O\u2082) with solid phases \u2014 disqualify them appropriately.\nFormat your response as a dictionary where each interpretation key maps to a nested dictionary with:\n- \"Likelihoods\": {{phase (space group #): value(float)}}\n- \"Explanations\": {{phase (space group #): explanation(str)}}\n- \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": float\n- \"Interpretation_Explanation\": str\n\nThe following examples are provided for demonstration purposes:\n\n- Example 1:\nSolid state synthesis: gram-quantity precursors are mixed and heated in a furnace.\nTarget: ZrTiO4  \nPrecursors: ZrO2, TiO2  \nTemperature: 1273.15 K (1000\u00b0C)  \nDwell Duration: 4.0 hours  \nFurnace: Box furnace with ambient air\n\nInterpretations:\n- I_1: ZrTiO4 (space group 18, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 5.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2), TiO2 (space group 141, weight fraction 6.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2), Al2TiO5 (space group 63, weight fraction 9.00%, fractional_composition = {'Al': 0.25, 'Ti': 0.125, 'O': 0.625}, approximately equal to Al2TiO5)\n- I_2: ZrTiO4 (space group 60, weight fraction 80.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1667, 'Ti': 0.1667, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTiO4), ZrO2 (space group 14, weight fraction 20.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrO2)\n- I_3: ZrTi2O6 (space group 14, weight fraction 85.00%, fractional_composition = {'Zr': 0.1111, 'Ti': 0.2222, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to ZrTi2O6), TiO2 (space group 136, weight fraction 15.00%, fractional_composition = {'Ti': 0.3333, 'O': 0.6667}, approximately equal to TiO2)\n\nComposition balance scores:\n- I_1: 0.940\n- I_2: 0.900\n- I_3: 0.783\n\n\nExpected likelihoods and explanations:\n{\n\"I_1\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": 0.4,\n    \"ZrO2 (space group 14)\": 0.85,\n    \"TiO2 (space group 141)\": 0.2,\n    \"Al2TiO5 (space group 63)\": 0.6\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n    \"ZrTiO4 (space group 18)\": \"Space group 18 (P2\u2081) is not the correct structure for ZrTiO\u2084 under high-temperature solid-state synthesis.

A high composition balance score and chemically plausible phases increase the likelihood.\n\nThe final answer is: \n{\n\"I_1\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n        \"CaC2 (space group 2)\": 0.1,\n        \"CaO2 (space group 5)\": 0.2,\n        \"Ca (space group 194)\": 0.05,\n        \"V5O9 (space group 2)\": 0.6,\n        \"CaC2 (space group 12)\": 0.1\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n        \"CaC2 (space group 2)\": \"Unlikely due to C not expected in product.\",\n        \"CaO2 (space group 5)\": \"Not common; CaO more stable.\",\n        \"Ca (space group 194)\": \"Metallic Ca unlikely in inert but not reducing atmosphere.\",\n        \"V5O9 (space group 2)\": \"Plausible reduced vanadium oxide.\",\n        \"CaC2 (space group 12)\": \"Same as space group 2, unlikely.\"\n    },\n    \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": 0.2,\n    \"Interpretation_Explanation\": \"Several phases are unlikely or metallic, reducing credibility.\"\n},\n\"I_2\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n        \"CaC2 (space group 2)\": 0.1,\n        \"Ca5V3O13 (space group 176)\": 0.8,\n        \"V9O17 (space group 2)\": 0.7,\n        \"CaCO3 (space group 167)\": 0.5,\n        \"CaC2 (space group 12)\": 0.1\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n        \"CaC2 (space group 2)\": \"Unlikely.\",\n        \"Ca5V3O13 (space group 176)\": \"Plausible calcium vanadate.\",\n        \"V9O17 (space group 2)\": \"Plausible reduced vanadium oxide.\",\n        \"CaCO3 (space group 167)\": \"Possible unreacted precursor.\",\n        \"CaC2 (space group 12)\": \"Unlikely.\"\n    },\n    \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": 0.6,\n    \"Interpretation_Explanation\": \"Plausible phases but C-based phases are unlikely.\"\n},\n\"I_3\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n        \"CaC2 (space group 2)\": 0.1,\n        \"Ca60C20O143 (space group 62)\": 0.1,\n        \"CaC2 (space group 12)\": 0.1,\n        \"Ca (space group 194)\": 0.05,\n        \"V5O9 (space group 2)\": 0.6\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n        \"CaC2 (space group 2)\": \"Unlikely.\",\n        \"Ca60C20O143 (space group 62)\": \"Unlikely due to complex formula.\",\n        \"CaC2 (space group 12)\": \"Unlikely.\",\n        \"Ca (space group 194)\": \"Unlikely.\",\n        \"V5O9 (space group 2)\": \"Plausible.\"\n    },\n    \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": 0.1,\n    \"Interpretation_Explanation\": \"Several phases highly unlikely.\"\n},\n\"I_4\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n        \"CaC2 (space group 2)\": 0.1,\n        \"CaO2 (space group 5)\": 0.2,\n        \"Ca (space group 194)\": 0.05,\n        \"V5O9 (space group 2)\": 0.6,\n        \"V2O5 (space group 15)\": 0.8\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n        \"CaC2 (space group 2)\": \"Unlikely.\",\n        \"CaO2 (space group 5)\": \"Not common.\",\n        \"Ca (space group 194)\": \"Unlikely.\",\n        \"V5O9 (space group 2)\": \"Plausible.\",\n        \"V2O5 (space group 15)\": \"Stable vanadium oxide.\"\n    },\n    \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": 0.4,\n    \"Interpretation_Explanation\": \"Some phases unlikely, but V2O5 is plausible.\"\n},\n\"I_5\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n        \"CaC2 (space group 2)\": 0.1,\n        \"Ca5V3O13 (space group 176)\": 0.8,\n        \"V9O17 (space group 2)\": 0.7,\n        \"CaCO3 (space group 167)\": 0.5,\n        \"V2O5 (space group 15)\": 0.8\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n        \"CaC2 (space group 2)\": \"Unlikely.\",\n        \"Ca5V3O13 (space group 176)\": \"Plausible.\",\n        \"V9O17 (space group 2)\": \"Plausible.\",\n        \"CaCO3 (space group 167)\": \"Possible unreacted precursor.\",\n        \"V2O5 (space group 15)\": \"Stable.\"\n    },\n    \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": 0.8,\n    \"Interpretation_Explanation\": \"Plausible phases, good balance.\"\n},\n\"I_6\": {\n    \"Likelihoods\": {\n        \"CaCO3 (space group 2)\": 0.5,\n        \"V2O5 (space group 15)\": 0.8,\n        \"V6O13 (space group 69)\": 0.6,\n        \"CaC2 (space group 12)\": 0.1,\n        \"CaCO3 (space group 167)\": 0.5\n    },\n    \"Explanations\": {\n        \"CaCO3 (space group 2)\": \"Unreacted precursor.\",\n        \"V2O5 (space group 15)\": \"Stable.\",\n        \"V6O13 (space group 69)\": \"Plausible reduced phase.\",\n        \"CaC2 (space group 12)\": \"Unlikely.\",\n        \"CaCO3 (space group 167)\": \"Unreacted precursor.\"\n    },\n    \"Interpretation_Likelihood\": 0.7,\n    \"Interpretation_Explanation\": \"Plausible unreacted precursors and reduced vanadium oxide.\"\n}\n}",
