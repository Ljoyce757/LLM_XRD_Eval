**Phase Likelihood Scoring:**
- Score each **individual phase** from 0 to 1 (likelihood it has formed under the synthesis conditions).
- Penalize polymorphs that are not stable at the synthesis temperature (e.g., low-T polymorphs at high T), but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.
- If a polymorph is less stable but still possible due to mechanisms such as kinetic trapping or low synthesis duration, assign reduced likelihood (e.g., 0.5).
- If a phase is a known precursor or may remain unreacted, assign moderate likelihood (e.g., 0.4–0.6). If it is particularly inert under these conditions, assign higher (0.7–0.8).
- If a phase is physically implausible (e.g., CO as a solid, a gas-phase species, or a high-energy transient), assign near-zero likelihood (0.0–0.1). This should always be penalized more than plausible phases.

**Interpretation Likelihood (overall):**
- This is **not an average** of individual phase likelihoods.
- Score the overall interpretation based on the **compatibility, plausibility, and completeness** of the phase set as a whole.
- If a phase is implausible, penalize the overall interpretation likelihood significantly.
- If likely phases are **missing**, reduce the interpretation likelihood even if the present phases are individually plausible. For example, if only one phase is present but synthesis conditions suggest a multiphase product, reduce the score accordingly.
- Respect the reported weight fractions when considering importance or impact on interpretation.
- Consider the composition balance when evaluating interpretation likelihood. The balance score should be close to 1.0—if it is significantly lower (e.g., < 0.9), this indicates missing or excess elements and should result in a substantial penalty to the interpretation likelihood.
- Even if all listed phases are individually plausible, if any key precursor element is completely missing from the phase set, the interpretation likelihood must be harshly penalized (e.g., assigned a near-zero score). This issue overrides other plausibility factors.

**Completeness Check – Requirement:**
- Penalize interpretations that **omit plausible or expected phases** based on the synthesis conditions, but do **not assign 0** unless they are physically implausible or thermodynamically forbidden.
- Penalize single-phase interpretations if other by-products, unreacted precursors, or side products would also be expected under the conditions.
- If the list is incomplete (e.g., missing likely by-products or unreacted precursors), apply a modest penalty depending on severity.

**Explanation Requirements:**
- For **each phase**, provide:
    1. A list of reasons / factors for a reduced likelihood score, along with the strength of each factor.
    2. For example, if the **polymorph** is less favorable, explain **how much** this affects its likelihood (not just that it’s less stable). Use labels where appropriate to classify polymorphs as:
    - **Ground-state**
    - **Metastable**
    - **Kinetically trapped**
    - **Unknown/ambiguous**
    3. Use temperature, redox potential, and kinetics to justify likelihood numerically where possible. For example, provide rationales for whether a particular oxidation state in the product might form given starting precursors and reaction conditions. Consider whether anion groups such as carbonates are likely to decompose or be retained.


**Stability Reminder (important):**
- Do NOT allow the same interpretation to vary significantly in likelihood across runs.
- Use deterministic logic, synthesis rules, and known reaction windows to ground your scoring.

Finally, remember that these phase interpretations are from x-ray diffraction measurements and therefore correspond to solid-phase crystalline materials. Glassy materials or gas phase species will not be included in the interpretation.


**Do not** confuse gas-phase species (e.g., CO, O₂) with solid phases — disqualify them appropriately.
